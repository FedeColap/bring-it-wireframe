            <p>You might have already noticed it... <br> 
              parmesan cheese is pretty expensive at the market - and is not even called parmesan, but parmigiano. <br>
              Same goes with chocolate, jeans, shoes... everything that is imported. <br> 
              Sure this is due to custom duties and transportation, but a good chunk of the price goes to profits for importing companies... resulting in some products being paid up to six times their fair price (if not even more...). <br>
              Imagine you have a friend who is traveling to Italy. Would you ask him "oh, could you bring me back this, please?"</p>
              <p>That is where this App comes into plays. <br>
              Connecting people who are planning to travel to a Country with other people interested in a specific little item. <br> 
              For a little surcharge over the regular price, or a small flat amount (your friend should be rewarded for his courtesy, after all!) you could have that item you wished for, straight from the Country of origin!</p>
              <p>This is Bring It (Please).</p>
